# Node Chat Room
---

This is an exercise in making a chat room using node.js. Some of the key features include: 

1. App launches a server establishing a connection to the client via an HTTP socket connection.
2. Client and server have unique parse methods for transmitting client messages from the client to the chatroom via the server.
3. Username and chatrooms are connected to the socket id allowing users to dynamically change their username and chatroom from the message prompt.

To Run:
1. Clone Repo
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Run 'node lib/app.js'
4. Navigate to 'localhost:8000'
